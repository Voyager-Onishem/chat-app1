# Data Fetching Issues Fix Summary

## Root Cause Discovered:
After analyzing your existing database policies, I found the **PRIMARY ISSUE**:

ðŸš¨ **MISSING BASIC SELECT POLICY FOR PROFILES TABLE** ðŸš¨

Your profiles table only had these policies:
- "Admins can manage all profiles" (admin only)
- "Users can insert their own profile" (INSERT only)
- "Users can update their own profile" (UPDATE only)

**BUT NO BASIC SELECT POLICY FOR REGULAR AUTHENTICATED USERS!**

This means regular users couldn't read ANY profiles, causing the 400 errors.

## Problems Identified:
1. **ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL**: Missing profiles SELECT policy causing 400 errors
2. **Query timeout errors** when switching windows/minimizing browser
3. **400 errors** with `user_id=in.(undefined)` - undefined values being passed to queries
4. **Window focus refetching** causing unnecessary re-queries

## Fixes Implemented:

### 1. ðŸ”§ FIXED THE ROOT CAUSE - Missing Profiles SELECT Policy
- **Problem**: No basic SELECT policy for profiles table for authenticated users
- **Fix**: Added `profiles_authenticated_read` policy:
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "profiles_authenticated_read" ON profiles
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (
      user_id = auth.uid() OR  -- Own profile
      (role != 'admin' AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL) OR  -- Non-admin profiles
      is_admin()  -- Admins can see all
    );
  ```

### 2. Fixed Undefined User ID Issue in Home.tsx
- **Problem**: `recentConnections.map(conn => conn.requester_id)` was returning undefined values
- **Fix**: Added filtering to remove undefined values before querying profiles:
  ```typescript
  const userIds = (recentConnections as Connection[])
    .map((conn: Connection) => conn.requester_id)
    .filter((id: string) => id && id !== 'undefined'); // Filter out undefined values
  ```
- **Added**: Proper type definitions for Connection, Profile, Job, Event, and Announcement interfaces
- **Added**: User validation check before fetching dashboard data

### 3. Improved Query Timeout Handling in useQuery.ts
- **Problem**: 15-second timeout was too long and queries were hanging
- **Fix**: 
  - Reduced default timeout from 15000ms to 8000ms
  - Improved timeout handling with AbortController for better cancellation
  - Added debounced window focus refetching (1-second debounce)
  - Enhanced error handling with proper cleanup

### 4. Enhanced Messages Component Query Management
- **Problem**: Aggressive refetching and long timeouts in conversation queries
- **Fix**:
  - Reduced timeout to 6000ms for conversations
  - Reduced retry attempts from 2 to 1
  - Disabled refetchOnWindowFocus to prevent unnecessary queries
  - Added proper user ID validation

### 5. Added Debounce Utility
- **Created**: `src/utils/debounce.ts` with debounce and throttle functions
- **Purpose**: Prevent rapid successive function calls when window focus changes
- **Implementation**: 1-second debounce on window focus refetching

### 6. Better Error Handling and Type Safety
- **Added**: Proper TypeScript type annotations throughout
- **Improved**: Error boundary handling in query execution
- **Enhanced**: User state validation before making API calls

### 7. ðŸ”— Enhanced Conversation System
- **Added**: Triggers to auto-populate `user_conversation_access` table
- **Fixed**: Automatic cleanup when participants are removed
- **Ensured**: Existing conversation policies remain functional

## Database Policy Fix Required:
The updated `comprehensive-working-fix.sql` file contains the **CRITICAL** missing profiles SELECT policy and other necessary fixes. **This must be applied to your Supabase database via the SQL editor.**

## Key Benefits:
- âœ… **FIXES 400 ERRORS** - Users can now read profiles properly
- âœ… Eliminates query timeouts from excessive wait times
- âœ… Prevents unnecessary refetching when switching windows
- âœ… Improves application responsiveness significantly
- âœ… Better error handling and user feedback
- âœ… Proper TypeScript type safety
- âœ… Auto-populating conversation access system

## Testing:
1. **Apply the SQL fix first** - this is critical!
2. Navigate to the home page - dashboard data should load without 400 errors
3. Switch to another window/minimize browser and return - should not trigger excessive refetching
4. Navigate to Messages page - conversations should load within 6 seconds
5. No more "Query timeout" or 400 errors in console

## Files Modified:
- `comprehensive-working-fix.sql` - **CRITICAL DATABASE FIX** (apply first!)
- `src/hooks/useQuery.ts` - Improved timeout and refetch handling
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Fixed undefined user ID filtering and type safety
- `src/pages/Messages.tsx` - Optimized query parameters
- `src/utils/debounce.ts` - New utility for preventing rapid calls

## Priority Order:
1. **ðŸš¨ FIRST**: Apply `comprehensive-working-fix.sql` to Supabase
2. **ðŸ”„ THEN**: Test the application - 400 errors should be gone
3. **âœ… VERIFY**: All dashboard counts work properly
4. **âœ… VERIFY**: Profile queries work without errors
